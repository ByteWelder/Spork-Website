# Spork Website

The Spork website is made with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) and the [Flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/) theme.

This repository hosts the source files for building it.

Building a new version:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

Trying out the current version locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
