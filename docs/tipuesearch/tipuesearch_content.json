To test performance, I created 2 new annotations with their own annotation binder: @BindTest1 and @BindTest2. Binding the annotation to an object increases a global static counter and does nothing else. This is to ensure that we are only measuring Spork performance and not any additional behaviors. Both annotations and annotation binders are in effect the same. This is to see potential differences in caching levels (JVM cache versus different types of internal caching). The type that we bind in the test has 5 fields that each have been marked with the annotation. It looks something like this: public class TestObject { @BindTest1 Object a; @BindTest1 Object b; @BindTest1 Object c; @BindTest1 Object d; @BindTest1 Object e; public void bind() { Spork.bind(this); } } There are several benchmarks and all benchmarks are ran 10 times: Bind 1 object instance with @BindTest1 fields Bind 1 object instance with @BindTest2 fields Bind 1000 objects instances with @BindTest1 fields Bind 1000 objects instances with @BindTest2 fields Raw results The results are available in the tab bar on the left. Conclusion Reflection is really fast on Android. It generally takes only several microseconds (not even milliseconds!) on Nexus 4 to bind an object. The very first binding (of any type on any instance) is a bit slower due to cache creation and\/or cache warming. This will take on average less than 10 ms on 4 year old hardware and I think this is very acceptable. The fastest cold cache binding time was 3 ms on a Nexus 4 and 1.354 ms on a Nexus 5X. Averages Binding on object took on average about: 0.0003 ms on the Nexus 5X with Android 7.0 0.002 ms on the Nexus 4 with Android 5.1.1 0.05 ms on the HTC One X with Android 4.2.2 First bind speed The very first bind throughout a benchmarking session always takes a bit longer. This is due to cold cache in Spork. The first instance bind took: 1.3 ms to 2.7 ms on the Nexus 5X with Android 7.0 3 ms to 12 ms on the Nexus 4 with Android 5.1.1 5 ms to 12 ms on the HTC One X with Android

release is done most packages are moved (and created .internal package) Spork\/SporkAndroid\/SporkAndroidSupport can now be instantiated (but a shared instance is available for Spork itself which suits most scenarios) @ComponentScope(Scope.SINGLETON) is now @Singleton spork-android library now uses support-fragment dependency instead of support-v4 and appcompat-v7 created ViewProvider to annotate POJO classes so they can work with @BindView removed custom support for RecyclerView.ViewHolder as you can now make it implement ViewProvider BindResourceBinder now uses newer Android API when possible caching is now flattened (removed custom models that held a separate layer of caching) caching uses less memory (ArrayList.trimToSize() where applicable) spork and spork-android now have an extension system to automatically load known dependencies: this is simpler (more reliable) and quicker updated to use new Android build tools improved tests and also started using Mockito FieldBinder, MethodBinder and TypeBinder are now more simplified removed logback from tests (because it wasn't being used) converted spaces into tabs where necessary implemented @Inject, @Nullable, @NonNull and @Lazy annotations @BindComponent and @ComponentScope are removed added jacoco for code coverage added dexcount plugin for spork-android and spork-android-support Old Release Notes spork
