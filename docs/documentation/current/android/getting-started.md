# Getting Started on Android

## Download

Edit `build.gradle` and add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'io.github.sporklibrary:spork-android:2.4.4'
}
```

You may also download the libraries manually through [maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.github.sporklibrary%22).

That's it! Check out the menu to see some examples or the list of annotations.
